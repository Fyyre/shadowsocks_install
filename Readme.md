TeddySun's entire Git repo has greatly simplified some of the Linux administration I do.

I am sad to see shadowsocks_install removed from his repository.  While we cannot speculate the reason for the removal,
it has been forked here, and shadowsocks_all.sh updated to download from my repo instead of his own.

Thank you Teddy Sun for your amazing shell script Linux work.  I personally adore you =)
